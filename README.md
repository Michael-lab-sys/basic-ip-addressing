Basic IP addressing &amp; Subnetting
I built a basic network lab using a FortiGate 60D as my main firewall/router.  
- Set up WAN & LAN interfaces
- Configured IP addressing & default gateways
- Enabled GUI management on LAN
- Verified connectivity & used FortiGate tools (ARP/DHCP) for monitoring
- Fixed a real-world IP subnet issue during GUI access
This hands-on exercise helped me strengthen my IP addressing, troubleshooting, and interface configuration skills essential foundations for network engineering.
